This sample project shows how the render container should be set up and has an example
gradient that roughly shifts the colors on the spectrum over.  Both in editor or when you run the project
you can change the parameters on the shader on the SubViewportContainer and see the changes
in real time.  The only change that won't update until you rerun the scene is the gradient
the recolor uses, so if you want to make changes to that you'll have to see the changes in editor.
